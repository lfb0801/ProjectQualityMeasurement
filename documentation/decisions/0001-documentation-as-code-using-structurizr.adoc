= Use Structurizr for Documentation

== Context

We treat documentation as code and want architecture-centric documentation that stays in sync with implementation.
Structurizr models system elements and their relationships and can embed ADRs directly into those models. By linking
ADRs and narrative docs to live architecture diagrams, reviewers gain immediate visual context. Encouraging updates on
every merge request helps keep docs aligned with reality.

== Decision

Adopt Structurizr as our primary Documentation-as-Code tool, integrating ADRs and narrative documentation into
Structurizr models.

== Decision Drivers

* *Architecture linkage*: Diagrams and ADRs live in the same model, improving traceability.
* *Sync with code*: Embedding documentation in code repos and CI pipelines encourages updates on merges.
* *Reader comprehension*: Visual context reduces cognitive load and accelerates onboarding.

== Considered Alternatives

* *Plain Markdown + static diagrams*
** Pros: Low overhead, no new tooling.
** Cons: Diagrams age out of sync; no live linkage to ADRs or code.
* *MkDocs / Sphinx*
** Pros: Rich text formatting, plugin ecosystem.
** Cons: Separate from architecture model; requires manual diagram maintenance.
* *PlantUML in repo*
** Pros: Text-based diagrams, embeddable in Markdown.
** Cons: Lacks built-in ADR integration and hosted visualization.

== Pros and Cons

|===
|Pros |Cons

|Live, interactive architecture diagrams |Learning curve for Structurizr DSL/API
|ADRs and docs linked directly to model elements |Requires implementing custom CI/CD integration
|Encourages documentation updates alongside code changes |Dependency on a hosted Structurizr service
|Improves reader comprehension with visual context |Potential licensing cost
|===

== Consequences

* *Positive*
** Documentation remains up-to-date and contextually rich.
** ADRs become discoverable via architecture views.
** Onboarding time decreases as readers see narrative and model side by side.
* *Negative*
** Team members must learn Structurizr and integrate it into workflows.
** Initial setup and CI integration will require effort.
