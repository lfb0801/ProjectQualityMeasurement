# ADR-002: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Documenting Technical Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In our software development process, we regularly make technical decisions that have long-term impact. Historically, these decisions have been recorded in an ad-hoc manner—via emails, meeting notes, or inline comments in code—leading to information loss, misunderstandings, and lack of traceability over time.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as our standard way to document significant architectural and technical decisions.

## Consequences
- ✅ Improves traceability of decisions and their rationale.
- ✅ Enables consistent documentation that can evolve alongside the codebase.
- ✅ Makes onboarding new developers easier, as they can understand the "why" behind existing structures.
- ✅ Facilitates better team communication and alignment, especially across disciplines.
- ❌ Requires discipline to maintain and update ADRs as decisions evolve.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Wiki pages or Confluence**: Too unstructured and prone to neglect.
- **Code comments**: Good for “how,” but often lack historical context or reasoning.
- **Meeting notes**: Scattered, hard to find, and rarely maintained.

## Justification
ADRs strike a practical balance between structure and overhead. They are lightweight, markdown-friendly, version-controllable, and align well with modern development practices.
