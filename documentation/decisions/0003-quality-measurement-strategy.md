# ADR-003: quality measurement strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The scope for this project is analyzing codebases that are so large that a developer can't use his/her own reasoning to determine where the quality of their application is declining.
This causes the scope of our quality scan to be large from the offset.

We also need to consider the [GAP-analysis](./documentation#gap-analysis) and create a clear distinction between ourselves and our two closest competitors. Where we found that SonarQube scans every single file, but has little to no insight into the project structure.
