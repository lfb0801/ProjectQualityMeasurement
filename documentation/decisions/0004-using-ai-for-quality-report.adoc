= Using AI for Quality Report

== Context

The project aims to analyze codebases that are too large for developers to manually assess quality issues. As it is challenging to determine the quality of such large codebases, we need to leverage AI to generate a quality report that
highlights key issues and trends.

Without AI assistance, the quality report may be too generic or not detailed enough to provide actionable
insights. AI can help in identifying patterns, anomalies, and trends that might not be immediately obvious through
manual analysis.

== Decision

We will output all findings from the analysis phase into a data structure that can be easily consumed by an AI model. We
can then try to use an AI model to generate a quality report based on this data structure. The AI will be tasked with:

* Summarizing key findings from the analysis
* Identifying trends and patterns in the data
* Highlighting areas of concern or improvement
* Providing actionable recommendations based on the analysis
* Generating a human-readable report that can be easily understood by developers and stakeholders
* Ensuring the report is tailored to the specific codebase and its historical context
* Incorporating any additional context or metadata that may be relevant to the analysis

=== Decision Drivers

* *Enabling AI*: The goal of the project is to find quality issues that developers cannot find themselves. The power
 of AI is in pattern recognition and anomaly detection, which can help identify issues that are not immediately
 obvious.

== Consequences

=== Positive

* ✅ AI analysis could be better than any formula that we could come up with ourselves, as it can leverage
 vast amounts of data and learn from patterns across multiple codebases.
* ✅ AI can theoretically improve over time as it learns from more data, leading to increasingly accurate and insightful
 reports.
* ✅ We can use Spring-AI, which is a Spring Boot library that provides a simple way to integrate AI models into Spring
 applications, making it easier to implement and maintain the AI analysis component.

=== Negative

* ❌ AI is inherently unpredictable, and the quality of the report may vary based on the model's training and
 capabilities.
* ❌ Need to export the analysis data into a format that can be consumed by the AI model, which may require additional
 work.
