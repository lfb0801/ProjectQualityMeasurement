== Overview

I take a similar approach to CodeScene, but make some different decisions that hopefully match better with the project
I've been tasked to investigate.

Where CodeScene uses a lot of Clean Code concepts to determine the health of the code, I mostly focus on the behavioural
interaction of the developers with the codebase.
But we do take a similar approach in architecture.

So we will use multiple scanners and aggregate the results into a single object that can be used to determine the
quality of the codebase.

== Implementation

In the following image I show the components that constitute the PQM-Server (Backend of the project).
The most important component in the `PQM-Server`, which is responsible for the analysis of the project, is the
[Scan Aggregator](#Aggregate).

=== LOCScanner (LOCC4J)

I am able to make detailed scans over the content of source files.
Thanks to the [LOCC4J](https://github.com/cthing/locc4j) library.
This allows me to ignore blank-lines and comments in my analysis.

Based on the research: [on how many lines of code can a developer maintain](), we learned that it isn't just important
to look at the LoC,
but that we should view churn on modules as an important metric for determining quality.

This implementation shows how I can use the LOCC4J library to make the distinction between Source and Test code

=== SonarQube (Not implemented)

In this project I use a local version of SonarQube, but normally I would expect a company to have already set up their
own SonarQube instance somewhere.

The reason I'm using SonarQube, is to make it do the Static Code Analysis.
This is only a cherry on the cake for my project, as it is mostly concerned the [JGit](#JGit) analysis

=== Aggregate

In the aggregate we determine the flow of our application, here we determine the behaviour/interaction with the
different scanners.
Then we take the resulting aggregate object and transform it for consumers of the aggregates.
