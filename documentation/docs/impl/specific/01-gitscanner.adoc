== GitScanner (JGit)

Thanks to https://github.com/eclipse-jgit/jgit?tab=readme-ov-file#java-git[JGit], I am able to interact with the VCS of
the given project and analyze the behavior of the developers inside the project.

It also allows me to increase the interval of analysis.
This is important as running my analysis on every build/commit would be expensive and wouldn't align with my research.

The JGit library allows us to create any complex Git-operation.
Using the following methods we can figure out how often a commit contained the given file.

This will allow us to figure out how often people edit the given file, which is potentially a bad sign.
